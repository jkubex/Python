    "Python - Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Literals are notations for representing some fixed values in code. Python has various types of literals - for example, a literal can be a number (numeric literals, e.g., 123), or a string (string literals, e.g., \"I am a literal.\").\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The binary system is a system of numbers that employs 2 as the base. Therefore, a binary number is made up of 0s and 1s only, e.g., 1010 is 10 in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Octal and hexadecimal numeration systems, similarly, employ 8 and 16 as their bases respectively. The hexadecimal system uses the decimal numbers and six extra letters.\n",
    "3. Integers (or simply ints) are one of the numerical types supported by Python. They are numbers written without a fractional component, e.g., 256, or -1 (negative integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Floating-point numbers (or simply floats) are another one of the numerical types supported by Python. They are numbers that contain (or are able to contain) a fractional component, e.g., 1.27.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To encode an apostrophe or a quote inside a string, you can either use the escape character, e.g., 'I\\'m happy.', or open and close the string using an opposite set of symbols to the ones you wish to encode, e.g., \"I'm happy.\" to encode an apostrophe, and 'He said \"Python\", not \"typhoon\"' to encode a (double) quote.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Boolean values are the two constant objects True and False used to represent truth values (in numeric contexts 1 is True, while 0 is False.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Extra***  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more, special literal that is used in Python: the None literal. This literal is a NoneType object, and it is used to represent the absence of a value. We'll tell you more about it soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An expression is a combination of values (or variables, operators, calls to functions ‒ you will learn about them soon) which evaluates to a certain value, e.g., 1 + 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Operators are special symbols or keywords which are able to operate on the values and perform (mathematical) operations, e.g., the * operator multiplies two values: x * y.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Arithmetic operators in Python: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (classic division ‒ always returns a float), % (modulus ‒ divides left operand by right operand and returns the remainder of the operation, e.g., 5 % 2 = 1), ** (exponentiation ‒ left operand raised to the power of right operand, e.g., 2 ** 3 = 2 * 2 * 2 = 8), // (floor/integer division ‒ returns a number resulting from division, but rounded down to the nearest whole number, e.g., 3 // 2.0 = 1.0)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A unary operator is an operator with only one operand, e.g., -1, or +3.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A binary operator is an operator with two operands, e.g., 4 + 5, or 12 % 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Some operators act before others - the hierarchy of priorities:\n",
    "\n",
    "the ** operator (exponentiation) has the highest priority;\n",
    "then the unary + and - (note: a unary operator to the right of the exponentiation operator binds more strongly, for example 4 ** -1 equals 0.25)\n",
    "then: *, /, and %,\n",
    "and finally, the lowest priority: binary + and -.\n",
    "7. Subexpressions in parentheses are always calculated first, e.g., 15 - 1 * (5 * (1 + 2)) = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The exponentiation operator uses right-sided binding, e.g., 2 ** 2 ** 3 = 256.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "VARIABLES:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A variable is a named location reserved to store values in the memory. A variable is created or initialized automatically when you assign a value to it for the first time. (2.1.4.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Each variable must have a unique name ‒ an identifier. A legal identifier name must be a non-empty sequence of characters, must begin with the underscore(_), or a letter, and it cannot be a Python keyword. The first character may be followed by underscores, letters, and digits. Identifiers in Python are case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means you don't need to declare variables in it. (2.1.4.3) To assign values to variables, you can use a simple assignment operator in the form of the equal (=) sign, i.e., var = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can also use compound assignment operators (shortcut operators) to modify values assigned to variables, for example: var += 1, or \n",
    "var /= 5 * 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You can assign new values to already existing variables using the assignment operator or one of the compound operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "input() function\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The print() function sends data to the console, while the input() function gets data from the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The input() function comes with an optional parameter: the prompt string. It allows you to write a message before the user input, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \". Nice to meet you!\")\n",
    " \n",
    "3. When the input() function is called, the program's flow is stopped, the prompt symbol keeps blinking (it prompts the user to take action when the console is switched to input mode) until the user has entered an input and/or pressed the Enter key.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Note  \n",
    "You can test the functionality of the input() function in its full scope locally on your machine. For resource optimization reasons, we have limited the maximum program execution time in Edube to a few seconds. Go to the Sandbox, copy-paste the above snippet, run the program, and do nothing ‒ just wait a few seconds to see what happens. Your program should be stopped automatically after a short moment. Now open IDLE, and run the same program there ‒ can you see the difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: the above-mentioned feature of the input() function can be used to prompt the user to end a program. Look at the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "name = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n",
    "print(\"Hello, \" + name + \". Nice to meet you!\")\n",
    " \n",
    "print(\"\\nPress Enter to end the program.\")\n",
    "input()\n",
    "print(\"THE END.\")\n",
    " \n",
    "4. The result of the input() function is a string. You can add strings to each other using the concatenation (+) operator. Check out this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "num_1 = input(\"Enter the first number: \") # Enter 12\n",
    "num_2 = input(\"Enter the second number: \") # Enter 21\n",
    " \n",
    "print(num_1 + num_2) # the program returns 1221\n",
    " \n",
    "5. You can also multiply (* ‒ replication) strings, e.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "my_input = input(\"Enter something: \") # Example input: hello\n",
    "print(my_input * 3) # Expected output: hellohellohello\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "if statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "This conditional statement consists of the following, strictly necessary, elements in this and this order only:\n",
    "\n",
    "the if keyword;\n",
    "one or more white spaces;\n",
    "an expression (a question or an answer) whose value will be interpreted solely in terms of True (when its value is non-zero) and False (when it is equal to zero);\n",
    "a colon followed by a newline;\n",
    "an indented instruction or set of instructions (at least one instruction is absolutely required); the indentation may be achieved in two ways – by inserting a particular number of spaces (the recommendation is to use four spaces of indentation), or by using the tab character; note: if there is more than one instruction in the indented part, the indentation should be the same in all lines; even though it may look the same if you use tabs mixed with spaces, it's important to make all indentations exactly the same – Python 3 does not allow the mixing of spaces and tabs for indentation.\n",
    "How does that statement work?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the true_or_not expression represents the truth (i.e., its value is not equal to zero), the indented statement(s) will be executed;\n",
    "if the true_or_not expression does not represent the truth (i.e., its value is equal to zero), the indented statement(s) will be omitted (ignored), and the next executed instruction will be the one after the original indentation level.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "if-else statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say, for example: If the weather is good, we will go for a walk, otherwise we will go to a theater.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know what we'll do if the conditions are met, and we know what we'll do if not everything goes our way. In other words, we have a \"Plan B\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows us to express such alternative plans. This is done with a second, slightly more complex form of the conditional statement, the if-else statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if true_or_false_condition:\n",
    "    perform_if_condition_true\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    perform_if_condition_false\n",
    "Thus, there is a new word: else – this is a keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "The part of the code which begins with else says what to do if the condition specified for the if is not met (note the colon after the word).\n",
    "\n",
    "The if-else execution goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "if the condition evaluates to True (its value is not equal to zero), the perform_if_condition_true statement is executed, and the conditional statement comes to an end;\n",
    "if the condition evaluates to False (it is equal to zero), the perform_if_condition_false statement is executed, and the conditional statement comes to an end.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "nested -if-else statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "consider the case where the instruction placed after the if is another if.\n",
    "this use of the if statement is known as nesting; remember that every else refers to the if which lies at the same indentation level; you need to know this to determine how the ifs and elses pair up;\n",
    "consider how the indentation improves readability, and makes the code easier to understand and trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "elif statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "elif is used to check more than just one condition, and to stop when the first statement which is true is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "if the_weather_is_good:\n",
    "    go_for_a_walk()\n",
    "elif tickets_are_available:\n",
    "    go_to_the_theater()\n",
    "elif table_is_available:\n",
    "    go_for_lunch()\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    play_chess_at_home()\n",
    " \n",
    "The way to assemble subsequent if-elif-else statements is sometimes called a cascade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice again how the indentation improves the readability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some additional attention has to be paid in this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "you mustn't use else without a preceding if;\n",
    "else is always the last branch of the cascade, regardless of whether you've used elif or not;\n",
    "else is an optional part of the cascade, and may be omitted;\n",
    "if there is an else branch in the cascade, only one of all the branches is executed;\n",
    "if there is no else branch, it's possible that none of the available branches is executed.\n",
    "\n",

    "the in keyword introduces a syntax element describing the range of possible values being assigned to the control variable;\n",
    "the range() function (this is a very special function) is responsible for generating all the desired values of the control variable; in our example, the function will create (we can even say that it will feed the loop with) subsequent values from the following set: 0, 1, 2 .. 97, 98, 99; note: in this case, the range() function starts its job from 0 and finishes it one step (one integer number) before the value of its argument;\n",
    "note the pass keyword inside the loop body – it does nothing at all; it's an empty instruction – we put it here because the for loop's syntax demands at least one instruction inside the body (by the way – if, elif, else and while express the same thing)\n",
